Thoughts behind the 'AI'
Rolls will need to be ordered from least to greatest or vice versa (maybe for player too? will think on this)
after rolling,if large straight AI hasn't been filled, will go through and look for large straight, if found ends roll turn
checks next for small straight availability and values,
if not found search instead for matching pairs, if found saves dice and rolls remaining. If new dice = value of old die, keep and roll different
If no pairs are found, keep 3-6 and roll remaining
at end of roll turn, run function to check scores. checks scores potentials if available, and chooses the largest value and stores their score thusly
AI playstyle is modeled after my own. May need tweaks, but I feel this will make a decent opponent
